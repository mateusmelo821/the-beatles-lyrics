# README

This a data science project where I have made use of the data from the [azlyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/) and [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary) websites to investigate the lyrics of The Beatles songs. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (BeautifulSoup, pandas, requests and re), Jupyter notebooks, web scraping, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/the-beatles-lyrics/).
