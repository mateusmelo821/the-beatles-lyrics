Yeah.
OK.
This is gonna knock you out, boy.

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

When all the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance for that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Yeah, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be, yeah

Yeah

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be, yeah

Oh, let it be
Let it be

I think that was rather grand
I'll take one home with me
Ok, let's track it
Oh, you bounder, you cheat!
