

Yes, sir. Take one! It's the Mighty Jungle Band!

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face."
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's stores
Buys a twenty-carat golden ring 
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And when he gives it to her she begins to sing 

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home, sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on 
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home, sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand 
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

Ob-la-di-b-la-da

Ob-la-di ob-la-da, brother
