

From the heart of the black country!
When I was a robber in Boston place
You gathered round me with your fine embrace

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad 
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain
Hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Nah...

Hey, Jude, don't let me down
She has found her, go out and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Better, better, better, better, better...

So let it out and let it in
Hey, Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey, Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better, better, better, better, better... oh!

Yeah
Nah, nah nah, nah nah, nah, nah, nah nah
Hey, Jude...
